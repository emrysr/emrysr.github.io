# [emrys.cymru](http://emrys.cymru)
Repo for my personal website. 
Currently this is hosted by github.io using ]github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I've set an CNAME record for a subdomain [github.emrys.cymru](https://github.emrys.cymru) to point to emrysr.github.io.

This is then routed to this repo using the [CNAME](https://github.com/emrysr/emrysr.github.io/blob/master/CNAME) file.

## Objective
This my personal website to show off my work. any serverside processing must be done via apis as github pages doesn't offer this service.
